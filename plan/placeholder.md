## Your Project 1 Submission Date

1. When (Plan): October 14th
2. When (Actual): October 18th @11:59 pm
3. Comment: I want to get this done as soon as possible. A little bit after I finish up HW3. This is so that I don't have to worry about it too much and is already turned in. If I finish it soon after HW3, then all of the knowledge will still be fresh in my mind and I would be able to work efficiently.
